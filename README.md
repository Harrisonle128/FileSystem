# File System with HashMap Implementation

## Overview

This project focuses on  implementing a custom `HashMap` data structure in Java. The project involves understanding the internal workings of hash maps, such as handling collisions and optimizing data retrieval. Additionally, this project simulates a basic file system that leverages the `HashMap` for efficient data storage and access.
